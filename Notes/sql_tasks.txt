1. How to check for duplicate pending requests in the database:

        SELECT * FROM request r WHERE (SELECT Count(*) FROM request q WHERE
        q.marshal_id = r.marshal_id AND q.obs_seq = r.obs_seq AND
        q.status = 'PENDING' AND r.status = 'PENDING') > 1;

        Note: It's OK to have duplicate requests if they aren't requesting the
        same observations (obs_seq).  For example, one request might ask for
        an ifu observation and another might ask for rc observations.
